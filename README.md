# Microhop - initramfs helper

You do not always need Dracut. ðŸ˜‰ Sometimes you want it really-really
small, tiny and completely stripped from everything. This is what
`microhop` is for: use mainline Linux Kernel straight to the point,
omitting many generic moving parts.

# Tutorial

### Overview

**Microhop** when deployed consists of one binary utility and one configuration file:
  1. `microgen` â€” utility, that generates your initramfs as CPIO gzipped archive
  2. `/etc/microhop.conf` â€” main system boot configuration, can be also your profile

The resulting `microhop` binary is the very `/init` in the `initramfs`,
containing all required functionality, such as mounting, block device
detection, root switching etc. It will appear only inside the `initramfs` CPIO archive
and is not intended to use anywhere else.

The `microgen` binary is the utility which generates the `initramfs` archive.
This archive then you will copy into the `/boot` directory of your Linux image.

### Building

> **WARNING: Do not build it directly using `cargo`, because you will get it all wrong!**

To build Microhop, first clone this repository and then just run:

	make build-release

In `./target/release` you should have a binary, called `microgen`. This is all you need.

#### Note on Dependencies

You might need to adjust your setup. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu you would need to
install the following packages:

- `libclang-dev`
- `libblkid-dev`

On openSUSE Leap `static-pie` linking is *broken*, and only `static` is available. With that in mind,
only `"thin"` LTO for the release profile is available _(unless it was fixed)_. Additionally,
you will need the following packages on openSUSE Leap:

- `libblkid-devel-static`
- `glibc-devel-static`


### Configuration

Configuration is also a profile. This is the basic start:

```yaml
# The list of kernel modules
modules:
  - virtio_blk
  - xfs

# Devices
disks:
  # Directly access device:
  # /dev/vda3: xfs,/,rw
  #
  # Access device via label:
  # ROOT: xfs,/,rw
  #
  # Access device via UUID:
  24e1daee-e09b-4fd5-97f3-dde8aba6ad8a: xfs,/,rw

# Optionally, define a custom init app
init: /usr/bin/bash

# Optionally, define a temporary sysroot.
# Default: /sysroot
sysroot: /sysroot

# Optionally, set debug log output. If this option is removed, default is used.
# Choose one from:
# - debug
# - info (default)
# - quiet (errors only)
log: debug
```

Resulting configuration will just contain more modules (their dependencies). The rest will be passed through.

### Generating initramfs

Essentially, the workflow is very simple:

1. Point which kernel you want to use and where it is
2. "Press a pedal" to get a new `initramfs`
3. Wait whole 0.05 seconds and you have it. ðŸ˜‰

To achieve this, do the following:

1. Mount your root filesystem, which you want to update with the new `initramfs`. As an example, setup
  a device with `losetup` and then mount one of its partitions:
   ```shell
   sudo mount /dev/loop1p3 /mnt
   ```

2. Let `microgen` generate it _(NOTE: this is an example, your filenames may differ)_:

   ```shell
   sudo microgen new --root /mnt --config microhop.conf --file /mnt/boot/initrd-5.14.21-default
   ```

   This command above is analysing your root filesystem at `/mnt`, will use `microhop.conf` as a profile and will write the output CPIO archive to the path, specified by `--file` option.

3. Un-mount your image:

   ```shell
   sudo umount /mnt
   ```

That's basically it and hopefully it will even boot... ðŸ˜‰
